# Assert every in-scope source file carries the SPDX FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0 header
# within its first three lines.
#
# Scope is the set of git-tracked files (so untracked/ignored build trees are
# never scanned). The scope is an EXPLICIT allowlist of path globs, declared in
# IN_SCOPE below, so it can never silently drift as the tree grows.
#
# IN SCOPE (shipped source that must carry the SPDX header):
#   *.go                      — daemon source
#   *.sh                      — shell tooling
#   .github/workflows/*.yml   — CI workflow definitions
#   Dockerfile                — the shipped build recipe
#   contrib/systemd/*.service — the shipped systemd unit
#
# DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE (documented so the omission is a decision, not a
# gap):
#   *.md                 — docs/prose; license is covered by the repo LICENSE.
#   examples/k8s/*.yaml  — Kubernetes manifests; YAML/k8s convention is no
#                          per-file SPDX, and the LICENSE governs them.
#   contracts/*.json     — JSON carries its own $comment SPDX and is checked by
#                          the contract-identity script, not here.
#   LICENSE*, NOTICE     — license texts themselves.
#
# The SPDX token is matched as a fixed string; comment lines are never
# bare-counted.
