# Multi-stage build for the ocu-filestored storage-broker daemon
# (component-04). The builder stage cross-compiles a static binary with the
# SAME flags the release pipeline uses (CGO_ENABLED=0, -trimpath, -s -w,
# main.version stamped via the VERSION build-arg), so the container binary
# and the released binary are build-identical. The final stage is distroless
# static running as nonroot: no shell, no package manager, no libc — the
# daemon is the only thing in the image.
#
# Both base images are pinned by multi-arch index digest (covers linux/amd64
# and linux/arm64); bumping a base is an explicit, reviewable diff.

# --- builder: runs on the build host's native platform and cross-compiles
#     for the target (Go needs no emulation to cross-compile), so a
#     multi-arch build never pays the QEMU tax in the compile stage.
